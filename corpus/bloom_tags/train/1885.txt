Nous rapportons le cas d’une patiente âgée de 49 ans sans antécédent pathologique notable, adressée pour l’exploration d’un carcinome ganglionnaire médiastinal angiosarcomateux hypertrophié (ADKT) initialement diagnostiqué comme neuroendocrine tumoral lésionnel sur MIBI(méthoxy-bis uridine) positron annihilable), ayant bénéficié ensuite d’une radiothérapie adjuvante totale de 60 Gy délivrée non fractionnée associée à deux ligne de chimiothérapie associant dexaméthasone – cisplatine and carboplatine + hydrocortisone in an effort to decrease the size of the tumor but it was never accepted by the survivants due to insufficient evidence for its utility or practicality at least compared with other forms of anticancer approaches like radio-chemotherapeutics that are generally viewed as more expensive per dose than chemoembolization which tends to produce lesser amounts of therapeutic effervescence without demonstrating their usefulness especially when moving forward toward developing novel therapies such as DNA-based vaccines against emerging cancer threats posed by rising scientists thanks to advances from fundamental biology breakthroughs revolutionizing our ability to solve today's challenges tackling tomorrow's most pressing problems currently facing humanity through discoveries geared towards bringing up newer innovative technologies able to answer mankind' s greatest concerns revolving around contemporary issues faced by human civilization every time we strive to bring forth something worthwhile irrespective of whatever technological capabilities being developed domestically
